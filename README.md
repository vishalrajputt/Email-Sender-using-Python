# Email Sender using Python

This is a Python script to send emails using the `smtplib` library. The script is capable of sending emails to multiple recipients at once.

## Usage

1. Fill in the `sender_email`, `receiver_emails`, and `password` variables with your email credentials.
2. Customize the `message` variable to change the subject and body of the email.
3. Run the script.

## Note

- This script uses Gmail's SMTP server, but you can use the SMTP server of any other email provider as well by changing the SMTP server address in the `smtplib.SMTP` call.
- Make sure to allow less secure apps to access your Google account if you are using Gmail.
